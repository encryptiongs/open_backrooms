# open_backrooms
Backrooms Game made with Unity by Backrooms community. The goal is to create a game that is based on the [Backrooms Wiki.](https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Backrooms_Wiki)

## Introduction
There are some Backrooms games on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=Backrooms), but they don't seem to be based on the community or the "official" research of the M.E.G.. So here I want to unite the Backrooms community and create a game that makes one feel like he/she is in the real Backrooms! 

## Status
3rd February 2023: The Project is born. It is expected that a sample scene will be uploaded soon. 

## What can you do? 
You can design level elements based on the [Backrooms Wiki](https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Backrooms_Wiki). 
They can be uploaded soon.
